Zod-Go is a Go-based validation library inspired by Zod in TypeScript. It provides an easy way for backend engineers to define schemas and validate complex data structures, such as arrays, maps, objects, and nested objects.

## Features

- **Schema Definitions**: Easily define validation rules for strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, maps, and nested objects.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Get detailed validation errors in both plain text and JSON formats.
- **Concurrent Validation**: Large datasets and nested structures are validated concurrently for performance.
- **Optional Fields and Default Values**: Support for optional fields and default values.
